  This is how the startup screen looks like. A sound will<br>
  play at the beginning and an image will be displayed.<br>
  One would enter values for the number of rows, columns,<br>
  and mines (in that order) in the <tt>EditText</tt> items. Then, the<br>
  "Build Grid" button would be pressed to create your own<br>
  customized Minesweeper game.<br>

  This is an example of what you would see if you pressed<br>
  all the <tt>TextView</tt> tiles. This is to demonstrate the use of<br>
  images and sounds. If you pressed on a tile that contained<br>
  a mine, you would hear an explosion sound and see an image<br>
  of a mine. If you press any other tile, you would hear a<br>
  clicking sound and see the number representing the number<br>
  of mines surrounding that particular tile.<br>
  <ul>
  <li>Used <tt>BitmapFactory</tt> and <tt>Bitmap</tt> to create mine images</li>
  <li>Used <tt>SoundPool</tt> to play the sounds</li>
  </ul>

  This is an example of what you would see if you won the<br>
  game. You would not see any mine images and a "tada" sound<br>
  would play to declare that you are the winner.<br>
